The purpose of this project is to develop a piece of software capable of characterizing the biological composition of a sample from the environment. In other words, to determine what microbial species live within a sample when the sample contains a multitude of different species. This problem presents a challenge due to the lage amount of information present within the genetic data used to identify the different species.
