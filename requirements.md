Introduce the major requirements of your project. While this will, of course, be brief at the beginning, it will grow as you learn more and develop your detailed requirements specification.

Functional Requirements
- Map genetic reads to references at a strain/species/genus level in order to identify the organisms within the sample.
- Provide information on the level of certainty for an identification.
- Pipeline must track its current step in the process
- Must be able to recover from a failure and restart where it left off.
- Must meet certain benchmarks for the indentification of different species as well as for the level of precision.

Non-functional Requirements:
- Fast. 
- Modular. Different modules of the pipeline must be able to be swapped out.
- Well documented and easy to modify.
